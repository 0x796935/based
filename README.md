# 🛰 About
This is a skeleton internal cheat base meant to be used for youtube tutorials. This was made to avoid having to recode all the boiler-plate nonsense each video.
A small function was added by me to hook into the DrawModel function of CS:GO to render the Chams.

- Intuitive project structure
- [MinHook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook) included for hooking
- [Interface manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0wGdwnaArA)
- [Netvar Manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCsNZ0GRVzo)
- Memory-related functions (Calling virtual functions, Pattern scanning)

## 🌠 Usage
